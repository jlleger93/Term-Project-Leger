<descriptions><description descriptionType="Abstract">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract The aim of this study is to analyze the trend of the main causes of death of women of reproductive age (WRA) in Brazil by age group from 2006 to 2019. Data used are from the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) of Brazil. The main causes of death of WRA (10 to 49 years) were divided by chapters as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). Subsequently, a temporal trend analysis was performed using polynomial regression models for the main causes of death in WRA. In Brazil, the highest mortality rates by cause by 100,000 WRA occurred due to: neoplasms (25.34), diseases of the circulatory system (20.15), external causes (18.69), infectious and parasitic diseases (8.79) and respiratory system diseases (6.37). For the analyzed period, after standardization, the mortality rate due to diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems, and infectious and parasitic conditions showed a decreasing trend, with a significant drop of 26.6% for diseases of the circulatory system; while external causes and neoplasms showed an increasing trend from 2006 to 2012 and decreasing from 2013 onwards. Identifying the main causes of death of WRA in each age group is required to guide the planning of actions to optimize resources and obtain better results in women’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></descriptions>
